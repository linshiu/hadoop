# Exercise 3

* Million songs: These is a subset from the million song database. From the data set, the records for years 2000-2010 (field 165) were extracted. For each extracted record the output file only had fields: artist name (field 2), duration (field 3), song title (field 1)

# Exercise 4

* For each artist in the data set, the maximum duration of a song was computed; the output is: artist, max duration of all his/her songs. Only 5 reducers were used and custom partitioners for sorting.
